# Android Entropy

Minimal Android Studio project that opens an activity to compute binary entropy (base-2).

How to open

1. Open Android Studio.
2. Let Android Studio import the Gradle project and download the Gradle wrapper and dependencies.

Notes

- This project is minimal and uses Kotlin and AndroidX.
- First Gradle sync may download Android SDK components and Gradle â€” allow the IDE to install them.
